# Face-Recoginition
I have Worked on Different Face recognition algorithms and techniques on Matlab as well as Python.
Implementing various Algorithms and feature extraction methods, clearly depicts the variation of result in accuracy also.
Comparative study towards this is highly needed to clear concepts in Depth.
This came to my interest after I started with a course of Machine learning (University of Washington)-Coursera. After few weeks, I got into an Internship on Domain Adaptation in IIT Patna under Head Of Department (CSE)- Respected Dr. Jimson Mathew.
